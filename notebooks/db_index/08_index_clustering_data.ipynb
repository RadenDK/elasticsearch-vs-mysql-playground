    "The idea here is that typically if you use a wild card like '%charger%' a index on the name would be useless because it cant traverse the index in a manner that will improve speed. It has to do a full scan in order to find every record where it could have a name like '%charger%'. But if you add the name to a index key it would be able to filter out at the index traversal all records where the condition is not satisfied.\n",

    "## Understanding MySQL `EXPLAIN`\n",
    "\n",
    "The MySQL `EXPLAIN` command is a powerful tool that helps us understand how MySQL plans to execute a query. It provides detailed information about what MySQL will do behind the scenes, which is very useful for learning about indexing, query optimization, and database performance. Key columns in the `EXPLAIN` output include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`select_type`**: Indicates the type of `SELECT` being performed. For example, whether it is a **simple** select (just retrieving rows) or a **primary/select with subqueries**. This helps differentiate between straightforward queries and more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`table`**: The name of the table being accessed by the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`partitions`**: Shows which partitions of a table (if the table is partitioned) are being scanned. Partitioning allows MySQL to split data across different sections for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`type`**: Often the most important column. It tells you the join type MySQL is using and whether it will scan the full table or use an index. Common values include:\n",
    "  - `ALL` â†’ full table scan (slow)\n",
    "  - `index` â†’ full index scan\n",
    "  - `ref` â†’ index lookup by non-unique key\n",
    "  - `eq_ref` â†’ unique index lookup\n",
    "  - `const`/`system` â†’ very fast, single-row lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`possible_keys`**: Shows which indexes MySQL **could potentially** use to execute the query. These are candidate indexes, but MySQL may not actually use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`key`**: The index MySQL **actually chose** to use for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`key_len`**: The length of the key MySQL decided to use. This indicates how much of the index is being leveraged, which can affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ref`**: Shows which column or constant is being used to match rows against the key. For example, it could be a column in the query or a constant value from a `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`rows`**: An estimate of the number of rows MySQL expects to examine to execute the query. This is based on table statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`filtered`**: A percentage estimate of how many rows will actually match the `WHERE` conditions after filtering. This helps understand MySQL's selectivity predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Extra`**: Additional notes about the query execution. Common examples:\n",
    "  - `Using where` â†’ MySQL is applying a `WHERE` filter after reading rows\n",
    "  - `Using index` â†’ MySQL is retrieving all information from the index without accessing the table itself\n",
    "  - `Using temporary` â†’ MySQL needs a temporary table (e.g., for `GROUP BY` or `ORDER BY`)\n",
    "  - `Using filesort` â†’ MySQL must sort results outside of the index\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore these fields in more depth and observe how they change depending on different queries and indexing strategies. Understanding `EXPLAIN` is key to writing efficient SQL queries and leveraging indexes properly.\n",
